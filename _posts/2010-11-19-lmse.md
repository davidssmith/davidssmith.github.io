If you have two images that can be arbitrarily scaled but you want to compare them in a mean square error sense, then I have a package for you.

The [least mean square error (LMSE) package](http://www.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/fileexchange/29461-least-mean-square-error-image-difference) contains two subroutines. LMSE computes the minimum mean square error (MSE) possible if one image is allowed to be linearly scaled in intensity.  Given a linear scaling of an image (slope and intercept), a pseudoinverse is used to solve for the two scalar parameters that minimize in a least-squares sense the difference between the image in question and a fixed reference image:

{% highlight matlab %}
A = ones(numel(target_image),2);
A(:,1) = target_image;
coeffs = A \ reference_image;
err = norm(coeffs(1)*target_image + coeffs(2) - reference_image) / ...
    numel(target_image);
{% endhighlight %}

Here both images are represented as column vectors.


LMSEDIFF computes the difference image after the target image is scaled according to the scaling that minimizes the MSE. This is a better way to compare images if the absolute magnitude of the intensity has no meaning.

*Difference between two Shepp-Logan Phantoms before (left) and after (right) LMSE scaling. You can see that the true, scale-free differences in the images are much smaller than a naive differencing would leave you to believe.*

The LMSE makes sense if all you care about are the features in the image, not the absolute pixel values. This is often the case in diagnostic radiology, for example.
