Welcome to the website for the paper [Exposure Rate Constants  and Lead Shielding Values for over 1100 Radionuclides](http://dx.doi.org/10.1097/HP.0b013e318235153a) by David Smith and Michael Stabin, 2012, Health Phys., 102(3): 271-291.
This site is intended to provide a central repository for the data and codes used to generate it, as well as to provide updates to the code, bug fixes, and errata.

* [MATLAB code](../assets/ERC_20121024.zip) (v.20121024)
* [Table 1](../assets/table1.csv) (CSV)
* [ICRP-107 data](../assets/icrp107.mat) (MAT format)

**Errata**: A few of the Mayneord f-factors in the published version of Table 1 are incorrect.  Due to a bug in the Matlab code, a few values were incorrectly output as 0.876 instead of the correct value.  If you are interested in a nuclide and the f-factor is listed as 0.876, please consult the CSV of Table 1 above to double check the correct value.

If you have comments, questions, or find a bug, please contact me.
