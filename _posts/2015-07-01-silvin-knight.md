Silvin Knight, an Irish Cancer Society Research Scholar from Trinity College University of Dublin will be visiting us for three months this summer.  He is building a prostate reference phantom for DCE-MRI that will allow us to determine whether the MR perfusion measurements have any basis in reality.

Please introduce yourself if you see him and tell him your worst Irish joke.
