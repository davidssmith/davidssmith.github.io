**sincos** -- Most modern CPUs have a built-in instruction
called `sincos(x)` that returns both the sine and the cosine of `x`.
In scientific computations, often you need both in your computation.  So instead of calling `sin` and `cos` separately, see if your programming language supports the `sincos` function, which is often just a thin wrapper to the processor intrinsic function.  If it does, you can get a 2x speedup in your trig calls for free.

**exp2** -- If you are raising 2 to a power, `exp2(x)` is much faster than `pow(2,x)`.

**expm1**, **log1p** -- For arguments close to 1, `exp(x)-1` and `log(1+x)` suffer from significant loss of precision. To avoid this, you can use `expm1(x)` and `log1p(x)`, respectively, instead, both of which compute the same thing using a different approximation with better error properties for values of `x` close to 1.

**atan2** -- If you are taking the arctangent of a ratio, `atan(y/x)`, then you cannot distinguish between `y/x` and `-y/(-x)` or `-y/x` and `y/(-x)`.  If you need to separate out all four quadrants, then you can use `atan2(y, x)` which gives you the correct sign of the angle considering all four quadrants.
