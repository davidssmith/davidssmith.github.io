Most modern CPUs have a built-in instruction
called `sincos()` that returns both the sine and the cosine of the argument
on the stack.  In scientific computations, often you need both in your computation.  So instead of calling `sin` and `cos` separately, see if your programming language supports the `sincos` function, which is often just a thin wrapper to the processor intrinsic function.  If it does, you can get a 2x speedup in your trig calls for free.
