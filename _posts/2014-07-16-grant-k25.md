I got a K25!

The K25 is a Career Development Award from the NIH NCI that funds my salary and a research budget for five years. My project is “Applying Compressed Sensing to Dynamic Contrast Enhanced MRI of the Breast”.

The official statement from my mortgage company is that they are “relieved and cautiously optimistic”.
