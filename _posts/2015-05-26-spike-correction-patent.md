Our [patent was granted](https://www.google.com/patents/US9042623) for a new technique of detecting and correcting pointwise errors in MRI data!

Thanks to the Vanderbilt Center for Technology Transfer & Commercialization for helping me through the process.  They made everything very simple for me and clearly explained every aspect of the process. If you think you have something worth patenting, and you work at Vanderbilt, I highly recommend giving them a call. 

You never know.
